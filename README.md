# Slide-Deck-Rmd
A slide deck created in `R Markdown`

# Description
I created this slide deck in `R Markdown` as a graduate-level class project in Spring 2023. We were tasked with downloading an open-source dataset, cleaning and preparing the data for analysis in `R`, and presenting the data in a short slide deck using various visualizations.

This Repository Contains The Following Files:
- `MilExp_Presentation.rmd` file 
- `index.html` slides hosted on gh pages ([View Here](https://jcook125.github.io/Slide-Deck-Rmd/#1))
